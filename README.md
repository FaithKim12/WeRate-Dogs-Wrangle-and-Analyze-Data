# WeRate-Dogs-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

## For this project, I will be working on the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs to create interesting insights and visualizations. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ tweets.
